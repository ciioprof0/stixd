# Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Controlled Natural Language (CNL) Development

## Background
This presentation explores the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in the development of Controlled Natural Languages (CNLs). CNLs are simplified versions of natural languages with restricted grammar and vocabulary, designed to reduce ambiguity and complexity. The focus is on using NLP to enhance the accuracy and consistency of threat descriptions in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI).

## Relation to INFO 523 Topics
Although specific NLP techniques were not discussed in this class, this project builds on the general principles of data mining covered in our coursework. It extends these principles to practical applications in developing CNLs tailored for cybersecurity, demonstrating the interdisciplinary nature of this field. NLP = supervised learning; neural nets; corpus; classification (covered); 

## Real-World Applications
Standardized CNLs can significantly improve communication and analysis in cybersecurity. By providing a consistent and unambiguous way to describe threats, CNLs facilitate better information sharing and collaboration among cybersecurity professionals. This standardization can enhance threat detection, incident response, and overall cyber defense strategies.

## Worked Example
The project includes an implementation of an NLP pipeline to develop and validate a CNL using a corpus of STIX descriptions. The pipeline processes the text, applies NLP techniques, and ensures that the resulting descriptions adhere to the controlled language's rules. This example demonstrates the practical application of NLP in creating effective and reliable CNLs for CTI.

## Conclusions
The use of standardized CNLs has the potential to improve interoperability and efficiency in CTI. By ensuring clear and consistent threat descriptions, CNLs can enhance the quality of threat intelligence and support more effective cybersecurity operations.
