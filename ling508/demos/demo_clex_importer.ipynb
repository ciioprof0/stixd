An administrator provides a URI to the lexicon file, and the system connects to the local database via the `mysql_repository.py` module. For each line in the lexicon file, the system extracts relevant character strings to create a word tag and form, generates a SHA256 hash of these components, and checks for the hash in the `lexicon` table. If the hash exists, it links the existing entry with the source ID; if not, it creates a new entry.

The project design leverages object-oriented programming principles to create a modular, extensible, and maintainable system, with key modules like `ClexImporter` and `MySQLRepository` facilitating database interactions and lexicon importation. The testing strategy includes unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the codebase. By executing the Clex Importer tool via the command line interface and web interface, users can seamlessly import Clex entries into the database, supporting ACE-based natural language processing tasks."
